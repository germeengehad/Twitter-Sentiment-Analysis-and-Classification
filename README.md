 - This project aims to analyze and classify a dataset of tweets into Positive, Negative, and Neutral classes using various models, including RNN, LSTM, SVM, and Naive Bayes.

- In this project, I decided to upload the dataset from Kaggle. After that, I applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing. I used text embedding for the RNN and LSTM models, and TF-IDF vectorization for the SVM and Naive Bayes models. Finally, I built and trained the models. 

# The Data Set
- There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral , there where 74996 row in the csv file of the dataset it include four coulmns unnamed but i renamed them to  id information labels text and i concatenate data of train and validation files togther
